    "In this project, a skill is defined as a job-related ability, certification, or competency required for the RN role. A predefined list of RN-specific skills will be created manually based on common nursing requirements. Both the job description and resumes will be cleaned using the same preprocessing rules. After cleaning, the system will check whether the skill words from the predefined list appear in the text. If a skill word is found, it is considered present for that candidate. This approach is simple, transparent, and easy to explain to non-technical users. However, it may miss skills that are written using uncommon or indirect wording."

    "Resume Scoring Logic:\n",
    "Each resume is cleaned using the same text preprocessing rules applied to the job description. After cleaning, the resume text is checked against the predefined RN skill list. For every RN skill that appears in the resume, one point is added to the candidate’s score. Skills that do not appear in the resume are ignored. The total score represents how well the resume matches the RN role. Candidates are ranked based on their total scores, where a higher score indicates a better role fit."
