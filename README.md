# FUTURE_ML_01
This project builds a resume screening system for a Registered Nurse role that cleans unstructured text, matches RN-specific skills, scores and ranks candidates, highlights missing skills, and visualizes results. It demonstrates an interpretable, recruiter-friendly approach to decision-support systems used in HR-tech and hiring platforms.
